# WASABI WordPress Plugins

Flashback to ... 14 years ago ... and probably eatlier. When I originally put them up on [PB Wiki]([url](http://wasabi.pbworks.com/w/page/5264038/FrontPage)) I wrote "I am not even sure if I would be of any use these days as I have stopped following WordPress development a long time ago." on the wiki page. These must be quite a bit older than 14 years. These WordPress plugins were created in the REALLY REALLY EARLY days of WordPress.

I put these files on [PB Wiki]([url](http://wasabi.pbworks.com/w/page/5264038/FrontPage)) on March 22, 2006 ... which was some time after I "stopped following WP development" and haven't updated the wiki since May 11, 2015. ðŸ˜†

In the plugin section below I am, for the most part, just pasting what I wrote on the wiki so many years ago. Nostalgia is a bitch, plus looking back at these 14 years later is really funny.

## The Plugins

### delicous cached

A show of hands of people who actually remember **del.icio.us**?

ðŸ¦—

I thought so.

***

del.icio.us is a great online social bookmarking service that lets you save and share your bookmarks online. This plugin is a quick and friendly way to integrate your del.icio.us bookmarks into your WordPress site. It is based on an another WordPress plugin that had a couple of issues:
 
It desperately needed a caching mechanism to avoid 503 errors when del.icio.us site was down and to avoid taxing del.icio.us servers with multiple requests.
The original author had not plans on developing the plugin any further.
 
#### Installation & Usage
1. Download the zip file.
2. Extract to a location of your choice.
3. Upload delicious.php to your WordPress plugins directory (/wp-content/plugins/).
4. Enable the plugin.
5. Place the following code anywhere in your template replacing "username" with your del.icio.us username.

`delicious('username');`
 
##### del.icio.us linkrolls
del.icio.us linkrolls quietly made this plugin obsolete hence the reason why I have pretty much discontinued any further development of it. However, you may still use it if you wish.
